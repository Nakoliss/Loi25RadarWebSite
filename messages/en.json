        "question": "What is Law 25?",
        "answer": "Law 25 (Act to modernize legislative provisions respecting the protection of personal information) is a Quebec reform that took effect in September 2023. It requires businesses to protect customers' personal data with requirements similar to the EU GDPR. Any business collecting data from Quebec residents must comply, with fines up to $25 million or 4% of worldwide revenue."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Monitoring?",
        "answer": "The Monitoring plan (Compliance Manager) includes monthly automated scans of your website. If new compliance issues appear (for example after a plugin update or adding new trackers), you receive an immediate email alert. This keeps you continuously compliant without having to remember to re-scan manually."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why scan regularly?",
        "answer": "Your website changes constantly: you add plugins, update your theme, install new marketing tools (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, etc.). Each change can affect compliance. Regular scanning automatically detects new issues before they become legal risks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it compatible with Wix / WordPress / Shopify?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our service works with all popular web platforms: Wix, WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, and even custom-built sites. For the \"Complete Scan + Fix\" plan, we fix issues directly by installing the right plugins, configuring cookie banners, and adding missing policies, whatever your platform."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take?",
        "answer": "- Complete Scan ($199): Report delivered in 24-48h\n- Scan + Fix ($699): Your site becomes compliant in 2 to 5 business days\n- Compliance Manager ($699 + $79/month): Initial compliance in 2-5 days, then automated monthly scans"
      },
      {
        "question": "What do I need to provide?",
        "answer": "Very simple! Please provide:\n1. Your website URL\n2. Admin access to your platform (WordPress, Shopify, etc.) - ONLY for the \"Scan + Fix\" plan\n3. For the basic scan ($199), no access is required\n\nAll access is secured and removed immediately after the fixes are completed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the penalties for non-compliance?",
        "answer": "The Commission d'accès à l'information (CAI) can impose:\n- Administrative penalties: up to $10M or 2% of worldwide revenue\n- Penal fines: up to $25M or 4% of worldwide revenue (for serious violations)\n- Private right of action: individuals can claim at least $1,000 per person\n\nThe CAI typically starts with an educational approach, but penalties are real for serious or repeated breaches."
